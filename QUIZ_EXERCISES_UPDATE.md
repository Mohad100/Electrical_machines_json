  - Loading exercises
  - Showing quiz results
  - Expanding exercise solutions

### Interactivity
- Toggle buttons switch between "Show Solution" and "Hide Solution"
- Smooth fade-in animation when solutions are revealed
- Responsive design maintains readability on all devices

## Benefits for Students

1. **Better Learning**: Explanations reinforce understanding of correct answers
2. **Self-Assessment**: Detailed quiz review shows exactly where improvement is needed
3. **Practice Problems**: Real calculation examples with full solutions
4. **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Students can follow the exact process to solve problems
5. **Immediate Feedback**: Visual cues make it easy to identify strengths and weaknesses

## Files Modified

1. `index.html` - Added exercises buttons and view
